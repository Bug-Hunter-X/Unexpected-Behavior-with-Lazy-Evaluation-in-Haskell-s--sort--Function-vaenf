```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```
This code snippet seems innocuous. It imports the `sort` function from `Data.List` and applies it to a list.  However, a subtle issue arises if you modify the list `xs` after sorting it. Because Haskell uses lazy evaluation, the sort operation is not actually performed until the result is needed.  So, if `xs` is changed before `ys` is used, `ys` may not reflect the sorted `xs`.

For example:
```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  xs <- return [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] -- modifying xs 
  print ys  -- ys might still be [1,2,3,4,5] or [5,4,3,2,1] depending on compiler optimization
```
This could lead to unpredictable behavior.
