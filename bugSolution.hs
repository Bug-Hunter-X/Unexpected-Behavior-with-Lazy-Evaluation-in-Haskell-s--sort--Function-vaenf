```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs --The sort is performed eagerly here
  print ys
  xs <- return [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
  print ys -- ys is unaffected by the modification of xs because the sort is performed eagerly
```
To fix the issue, ensure that the sorting operation is performed eagerly *before* the original list `xs` is modified. The change is simply forcing the evaluation of `ys`. This can be done using `seq` or other techniques to ensure the list is evaluated strictly.  This prevents unexpected behavior caused by lazy evaluation.
